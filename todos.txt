1. Slog cannot process string with spaces
    exp. it can process "I_am_a_string", but can't "I am a string"

2. Slog non-termination issue
    exp. doesn't terminate for tests like, length, map, foldr

3. Looks like buggy code
std::string print_val(void *val)
{
    switch (get_tag(val))
    {
    case SPL:
        if (decode_bool(val)) // SPL fine, but it does not have to be bool right?--in that case, decode_bool will generate error instead of returning true/false 
        {
            return "#t";
        }
        else
        {
            return "#f";
        }
        break;
