1. encoding/decoding for set is missing
    exp, set->list (void *prim_set_u45_u62list(void *h)), should check if the argument passed is set or not! 

    status: unsloved, but its working in kludgy way!
2. prim_exact_u45round
    what if the argument is an integer istead of float?

    status: unsloved
3. modulo
    for -7 3 it should return 2
    for -7 -3 it shoul return -1

    status: run test to see if it's working as expected!

4. Slog cannot process string with spaces
    exp. it can process "I_am_a_string", but can't "I am a string"

    status: unsloved

5. compare_lst (> and other logical operators)
    only supporting mpz! it should support floating point as well
    also what about 1 argument?
