; works: using specific apply-prim builtin
; but forms (+ 1 2 (+ x 3)) like this doesn't works, I guess the reason is same,
; whenever we are the the builtins, we break the flow
(define (call x)
    (+ 1 2 x) ; works
    ; (+ 1 2 (+ x 3)) ; doesn't work
    ; (+ 1 2 3 4 (+ x 1 2 3 4)) ; works
    )

(define (brouhaha_main)
    (call 1))

; works: falls back to generic case
; (define (call x)
;     (+ 1 2 3 4 5 x))

; (define (brouhaha_main)
;     (call 1))


; below case not working because, we are somehow disrupting the flow
; for applike cases like (call), without any args
; need to debug more...
; like, arg_buffer[2] = apply_prim__u43_3(a8341, a8342, a8343);
; then, what?

; (define (call)
;     (+ 100 80 10))

; (define (brouhaha_main)
;     (call))
